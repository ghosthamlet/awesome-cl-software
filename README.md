## Contributors

Thanks to All of Github contributors and Everyone @ reddit.com/r/lisp ad r/Common_Lisp/ for many suggestions and compliments.

## Guidelines to contribute

Please follow this format of the list  `[Appname](#link) - description. [License].`
if you want to make a contribution.

- Put the name of the **application** and **link** to its **homepage** in the list.
- Write a **short description** for the application.
- Add a **license** in the end of the list. *see the list format above*
- Make sure it is put under the **appropriate topic**.
- If the application doesn't fit in any **existing topic**, make a **new one** for it.
- Sort the item by it's popularity.
  - we come up with this approach since alphabetically sorted make people unnoticed which app has more active development and which app unmaintained or abandoned.

## Unsure how to contribute?

- [How to Use Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- [How to Git from the Command Line](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- [What is Markdown?](https://github.com/LewisVo/Markdown-Tutorial) - Markdown is the writing method used to create this list, if you want to know how to format properly, it's best that you learn how to use Github Markdown.
- [Alternative Markdown Guide:](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Note

- You can learn about licenses in [tl;drLegal](https://tldrlegal.com/)
- There are so many Applications buit with Lisp, but most of them are more than 20 years old, this [list will be endless](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/77tgpl/awesome_common_lisp_application_software/doprwez/) as Rainer Joswig said, so here I wil only include the relevant application.
